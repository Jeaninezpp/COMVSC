# Implementaion of Consensus One-step Multi-view Subspace Clustering

This package is an MATLAB implementation of paper 'Consensus One-step Multi-view Subspace Clustering' in IEEE TKDE.

If you want to run this algorithm, you can check the `run.m` file.

File `CLOMV_w` is the core part of our algorithm. It contains the details of the optimization.

You can find the datasets used in our paper in [this repository](https://github.com/Jeaninezpp/multi-view-datasets) .
